[h3]Retouched Human Gear Tool Tip Screen:[/h3]
The feature that started this mod in the first place, with general dislike of how the vanilla one look, i have decided to edit it to my liking

[h3]Retouched Briefing Screen:[/h3]
An best of both worlds, extended the briefing screen like how it was pre v1.0 but now with the latest update list support

(big briefings will show a list, small briefings will not)

[h3]Clean Replays:[/h3]
The Show HUD Button in replays will completely disappear (unless hovered on) now, enabling for clean replays to be recorded with the conjunction of cinematic mode being on

[h3]Reset Plan button in Playing Mode:[/h3]
Ever wanna reset your full plan without restarting the mission? Great now you can, the Reset Plan button will display in Playing Mode now

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
﻿Due to how this mod replaces the hud.xml file with no other way around it, this mod won't be compatible with any other mods that also replaces this file
