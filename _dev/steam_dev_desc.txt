A visual QoL mod that tweaks and alters certain HUD elements within the game, improving them and giving them better functionality in some cases

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Retouched Human Gear Tool Tip Screen
    [*]Retouched Briefing Screen
    [*]Clean Replays
    [*]Reset Plan Button in Playing Mode
[/list]

[h3]Retouched Human Gear Tool Tip Screen:[/h3]
The feature that started this mod in the first place, with general dislike of how the vanilla one look, i have decided to edit it to my liking

[h3]Retouched Briefing Screen:[/h3]
An best of both worlds, extended the briefing screen like how it was pre v1.0 but now with the latest update list support

(big briefings will show a list, small briefings will not)

[h3]Clean Replays:[/h3]
The Show HUD Button in replays will completely disappear (unless hovered on) now, enabling for clean replays to be recorded with the conjunction of cinematic mode being on

[h3]Reset Plan button in Playing Mode:[/h3]
Ever wanna reset your full plan without restarting the mission? Great now you can, the Reset Plan button will display in Playing Mode now

[h3]Compatibility[/h3]
﻿Due to how this mod replaces the hud.xml and the replay.xml file with no other way around it, this mod won't be compatible with any other mods that also replaces these files

[h3]Extra Info[/h3]
If you have any suggestions or issues please feel free to post me a msg here or @me on discord: anthony_dnb

Also I highly recommend of using Panguino's PanGUI mod that also changes certain HUD elements but focuses more on of giving an better visually pleasing look to the end user and changes the base game HUD Textures
